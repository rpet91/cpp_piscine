# cpp_piscine #11

My eleventh project of the 42 school Codam. This is the first C++ project and you'll start with the basics first. Every CPP module brings a new method where you have to work with.
CPP00: CPP syntax mostly, classes, initialization.
CPP01: Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, file streams.
CPP02: Polymorphism, operator overloads, canonical classes.
CPP03: Inheritance.
CPP04: Abstract classes, interfaces.
CPP05: Exceptions.
CPP06: Casts.
CPP07: Templates.
CPP08: Templated containers, iterators.

Almost every exercise can be compiled with ```make```. Run the program to see the test results.
